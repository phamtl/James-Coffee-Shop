                            <p>A coffee bean is actually a seed. When dried, roasted and ground, it’s used to brew coffee.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Coffee seeds are generally planted in large beds in shaded nurseries. The seedlings will be watered frequently and shaded from bright sunlight until they are hearty enough to be permanently planted. Planting often takes place during the wet season, so that the soil remains moist while the roots become firmly established.</p>

                            <p>The coffee cherry took approximately 3 to 4 years to bear from the coffee trees.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> There is typically one major harvest a year. The cherries may be picked either by hand or by machine. There are two types of harvesting:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Strip Picked:</strong>
                                 All of the cherries are stripped off of the branch at one time.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Selectively Picked:</strong>
                                 Only the ripe cherries are harvested, being picked individually by hand, only the cherries which are at the peak of ripeness are chosen.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>A good picker averages approximately 100 to 200 pounds of coffee cherries a day, producing 20 to 40 pounds of coffee beans.</p>

                                <strong>The Dry Method</strong>
                                 is an age-old method used in many countries where water resources are limited. The freshly picked cherries are spread out to dry in the sun. They are raked and turned throughout the day, then covered at night or during rain. This process might continue for several weeks until the moisture drops to 11%.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The Wet Method</strong>
                                 removes the pulp from the coffee cherry after harvesting so the bean is dried with only the parchment skin left on.</p>
                            
                            <p>First, the freshly harvested cherries are passed through a pulping machine to separate the skin and pulp from the bean.</p> 
                            <p>After separation, the beans are transported to fermentation tanks, where they will remain in for 12 to 48 hours to remove the slick layer of mucilage.</p> 
                            <p>The beans are passed through several processing machines, then rinsed by going through additional water channels, and are ready for drying.</p>

                        <div class="process_text_container">
                            <p>If the beans have been processed by the wet method, the pulped and fermented beans must now be dried to approximately 11% moisture to properly prepare them for storage.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>These beans, still inside the parchment envelope (the endocarp), can be sun-dried by spreading them on drying tables or floors, where they are turned regularly, or they can be machine-dried in large tumblers. The dried beans are known as parchment coffee, and are warehoused in jute or sisal bags until they are readied for export.</p>

                            <p>Before being exported, parchment coffee is processed in the following manner:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>Hulling</strong> machinery removes the parchment layer from wet processed coffee.</p>
                            <p><strong>Polishing</strong> is an optional process where any silver skin that remains on the beans after hulling is removed by machine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Grading</strong> and Sorting is done by size and weight, and beans are also reviewed for color flaws or other imperfections.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Finally, defective beans are removed either by hand or by machinery. Beans that are unsatisfactory due to deficiencies are removed. In many countries, this process is done both by machine and by hand, ensuring that only the finest quality coffee beans are exported.</p>

                            <p>Coffee is repeatedly tested for quality and taste.  This process is referred to as cupping and usually takes place in a room specifically designed to facilitate the process.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Samples from a variety of batches and different beans are tasted daily. Coffees are not only analyzed to determine their characteristics and flaws, but also for the purpose of blending different beans or creating the proper roast. An expert cupper can taste hundreds of samples of coffee a day and still taste the subtle differences between them.</p>

                            <p>Roasting transforms green coffee into the aromatic brown beans that we purchase in our favorite stores or cafes. Most roasting machines maintain a temperature of about 550 degrees Fahrenheit. The beans are kept moving throughout the entire process to keep them from burning.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When they reach an internal temperature of about 400 degrees Fahrenheit, they begin to turn brown and the caffeol, a fragrant oil locked inside the beans, begins to emerge. This process called pyrolysis is at the heart of roasting — it produces the flavor and aroma of the coffee we drink.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>After roasting, the beans are immediately cooled either by air or water.</p>

                            <p>The objective of a proper grind is to get the most flavor in a cup of coffee. How coarse or fine the coffee is ground depends on the brewing method.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The length of time the grounds will be in contact with water determines the ideal grade of grind Generally, the finer the grind, the more quickly the coffee should be prepared. That’s why coffee ground for an espresso machine is much finer than coffee brewed in a drip system.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>For example, Espresso machines use 132 pounds per square inch of pressure to extract coffee.</p>

                        <div class="process_text_container">
                            <p>There are a lot of ways to brew coffee; however, we are going to introduce a quite unpopular method to the world, the Vietnamese way of brewing coffee.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>By creating a slow, drip brewed coffee and combining the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, the Vietnamese have created a delicious style of coffee not commonly found in the Western world.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Vietnamese coffee should be made with Robusta beans, which are easier and cheaper to grow than Arabica beans. Robusta beans are notoriously strong and bitter; however, the Vietnamese worked out a solution to that by adding a generous helping of condensed milk to their coffees, which could counteract such bitterness.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Traditionally, Vietnamese coffee is brewed inside a phin filter. They are simple ceramic or stainless steel coffee filters with holes punched out of the bottom. It’s worth a notice that any drip coffee filter will work for brewing a Vietnamese coffee.</p>
